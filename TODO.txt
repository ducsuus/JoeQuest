TODO File - what needs to be done...


Mr Fridge - Incomplete:
	
	- Complete collision detection for Mr Fridge
		In the player entity class every time there is a collision the game needs to check to see if it is
		Mr Fridge the player is colliding with, if this is the case Mr Fridge needs to tell the player he
		is being walked into!
	- Setup text function
		There needs to be some kind of function which can be applied to all NPCs to be used for the NPC
		to talk - sound can be good but is normally a pain to understand, so the text needs to be clear.
