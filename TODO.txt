TODO File - what needs to be done...


Mr Fridge - Incomplete:
	
	- Complete collision detection for Mr Fridge
		In the player entity class every time there is a collision the game needs to check to see if it is
		Mr Fridge the player is colliding with, if this is the case Mr Fridge needs to tell the player he
		is being walked into!
	- Setup NPC text function
		There needs to be some kind of function which can be applied to all NPCs to be used for the NPC
		to talk - sound can be good but is normally a pain to understand, so the text needs to be clear.


#001
	
	In the player class, when a collision occurs instead of checking if it is of type "NPC" (or another
	static string), check from a global list of objects with collision activated. (Create a global list
	of all object types which are to be collided with.
	
#002
	
	In the player class, ensure the player does not walk through another object entity that is collidable
	(IE NPCs) - fix the bug which sticks the player to the NPC and does not let them back away!
